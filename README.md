# Instructions to connect DGX on prem cloud resources:


## Setup

### 1. SSH Connection and Setup
```bash
ssh [NETID]@dgx-head01.its.albany.edu
```

cd
mkdir .config
cd ~/.config

```md
# NVIDIA GPU Cloud (both endpoints are required)
machine nvcr.io login $oauthtoken password [APIKEY]
machine authn.nvidia.com login $oauthtoken password [APIKEY]
```

### 2. Transfer the scripts

- Use VSCode Remote Access to access your files on dgx-head01
    - [NETID]@dgx-head01.its.albany.edu

- Copy the scripts to your base directory
    - jupyter.sh
    - run.sh


## Running Jupyter

### 1. Start a job to run Jupyter

```bash
ssh [NETID]@dgx-head01.its.albany.edu

sh run.sh
```

- It will print which node is running the job (NODEID: dgx##)

### 2. Open a new terminal and leave it open to tunnel the port

> ssh -N -L 8008::8008 [NETID]@dgx-head01.its.albany.edu

### 3. Go to this address to access Jupyter

```md
http://[NODEID].its.albany.edu:8008/lab
```

### Extra. 

- If you want to see the status of your job again:

```bash
module load slurm
squeue -u $USER
```

- If you want to cancel your job:

```bash
module load slurm
scancel [JOBID]
```
